# STEPS THAT THE WHILE LOOP SHOULD FOLLOW
# 1: print board and ask player for where they want to place there X or O
# 2: first it will check whether or not the value they input is valid
# 3: check where spot is on the board  by row and col
# 4: check whether spot is taken or not
# 5: input players X or O in spot (should happen in print_board, i think)
# 6: check for win by row, col, and diag.
# 7: declare winner
# 8: if turn count hits 9 == tie

board = [
    ["-", "-", "-"],
    ["-", "-", "-"],
    ["-", "-", "-"]
]
turn = 0
player_turn = False

# THESE ARE WHAT STEPS I TOOK WHILE WRITING MY CODE
# 1: first thing i did was set value that i knew i needed for like board, player_turn, and turn.
# 2: then i commented at the top the steps that my while loop needed.
# 3: after i went through and defined all the functions i needed but didn't add anything to them.
# 4: i then finally started to fill out the while loop and then the function i need.
